# Genshin Scanner
I'll be using OCR APIs to make an app that scans an image for text, and output calculated data from it.

# Specs
- user can upload screenshots of their builds (start with 1920 x 1080 screenshots)
- use Genshin Impact database API
- use Free OCR API (ocr engine 2 for unique characters)
- research formulas for calculating damage in Genshin Impact
- output data to the user based off of their artifacts
- scan data, and match results with the database to verify proper data

# Features yet to implement
- support for mobile devices, and PS4/PS5 screenshots
